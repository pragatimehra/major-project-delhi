<h2>Delhi House Pricing Prediction</h2>

This repository showcases a web application designed to predict house prices in Delhi, incorporating a machine learning model and a Flask backend. The project utilizes a RandomForestRegressor algorithm trained on a dataset of Delhi house prices and an interactive chatbot for additional assistance.

<b>Key Features:</b>

    <h3>üè† Web Interface</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed an interactive and responsive web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</li>
        <li>Utilized Bootstrap for styling to ensure a visually appealing and user-friendly layout.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>üìà Machine Learning Model</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Trained a RandomForestRegressor model using scikit-learn on a dataset of Delhi house prices.</li>
        <li>Implemented data preprocessing techniques, including categorical encoding and outlier handling, to enhance model performance.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>‚öôÔ∏è Flask Backend</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Created a Flask server to handle incoming requests and seamlessly integrate the machine learning model for predictions.</li>
        <li>Established routes for rendering the home page and handling predictions based on user input.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>üìä Data Handling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Employed LabelEncoder for encoding categorical features, improving the model's ability to interpret location data.</li>
        <li>Conducted comprehensive data preparation, including log-transformations, to ensure robust model performance.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <h3>ü§ñ Chatbot Integration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Integrated a chatbot using NLP and deep learning to assist users with queries related to house pricing and application usage.</li>
        <li>Implemented the chatbot to provide real-time responses and enhance user engagement.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
<b> Usage: </b>

Users input location, area, number of bedrooms, and toggle various amenities on the web page.
Upon form submission, JavaScript sends the data to the Flask server (/predict).
The Flask server uses the pre-trained ML model to predict the house price and returns the result.
The predicted price is displayed on the web page. 
A list of property dealers is also flashed on the screen to assist the user with prompt resolution of queries related to the location/property.
Users can interact with the chatbot for additional assistance and information.
